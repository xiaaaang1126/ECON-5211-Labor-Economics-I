## TWFE model

```{R}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

## Simulation

First, we generate the simulated data point (1000 individuals â¨‰ 5 periods)

```{R}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the number of individuals and periods
n_individuals <- 3
time_periods <- 0:3

# Create a data frame with all combinations of individuals and time periods
data <- expand.grid(id = 1:n_individuals, time = time_periods) %>%
  arrange(id, time)
```

next, we randomly assign the treatment group and outcome variable

```{R}

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the number of individuals and periods
n_individuals <- 3
time_periods <- 0:3

# Create a data frame with all combinations of individuals and time periods
data <- expand.grid(id = 1:n_individuals, time = time_periods) %>%
  arrange(id, time)


# Assign treatment based on time period and cohort
# Treatment starts after time period 2 for cohorts 0 and 1
data$early_treated <- as.integer(data$id == 1 & (data$time == 1 | data$time == 2))
data$late_treated <- as.integer(data$id == 2 & (data$time == 2))
data$treatment <- (data$early_treated == 1 | data$late_treated == 1)

# Generate the outcome variable with a time effect, a cohort effect, and a treatment effect
alpha <- 5
beta <- 1
time_effect <- data$time
cohort_effect <- data$id

# Assign an indicator for the first period after treatment
# data$first_treatment_period <- as.integer(data$time == 1 & data$id == 2)
# data$second_treatment_period <- as.integer(data$time == 2 & data$id == 3)

# Simulate the outcome variable Y with an added random error
data$Y <- alpha + time_effect + cohort_effect + beta * data$treatment + rnorm(nrow(data))

# Adjust the outcome for the first period after treatment by multiplying by 1000
data$Y <- data$Y + (1.2 * beta * data$early_treated)
data$Y <- data$Y + (1.1 * beta * data$late_treated)

data <- data[order(data$id, data$time),]



# Fit a TWFE model without considering different treatment effects across cohorts
twfe_model <- lm(Y ~ factor(time) + factor(id) + treatment, data = data)

# Print the summary of the TWFE model
summary(twfe_model)

```

## Estimation

Finally, we utilize the TWFE model to estimate

```{R}
# Fit a TWFE model without considering different treatment effects across cohorts
twfe_model <- lm(Y ~ factor(time) + factor(id) + treatment, data = data)

# Print the summary of the TWFE model
summary(twfe_model)
```
Although the outcome value in treatment group in post-treatment period 1 and 2 are positive comapred with pre-treatment period, the TWFE estimation turns out to be negative.
